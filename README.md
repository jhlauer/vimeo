### Description

**To Run:**

- Download ```index.html``` to a local folder (ex - "Vimeo")
- Download ```pg1style.css``` to a local folder WITHIN the original folder ("Vimeo"). Name this folder "styles-css"
- Open ```index.html``` in your browser

### Note

Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I was unable to complete Step 2 of the challenge. While I am enrolled in a JavaScript course this semester, my knowledge of the language is still fairly basic, and React proved to be beyond my current skill set. 

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause in assessing my application, and hope you will still consider me for the position, as I would love to work in front-end development for Vimeo. I am confident that, as the semester progresses, my mastery of JavaScript will make me an excellent intern choice for your program.

Please see ```carousel.js``` for my attempt at implementing the React.js carousel. 

Please see ```api.py``` for my attempt at integrating the Vimeo API into my site.
